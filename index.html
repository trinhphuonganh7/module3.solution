                If there's another universe Please make some noise (noise) Give me a sign (sign) This can't be life If there's a point
                to losing love Repeating pain (why?) It's all the same I hate this place Stuck in this paradigm Don't believe in paradise 
                This must be what house is like There's got to be more, got to be more Sick of this head of mine Intrusive thoughts, they

                to break this pattern Of floating away Ooh (ooh, ooh) Find something worth saving It's all for the taking I always say I'll 
                be better on Saturn None of this matters Dreaming of Saturn, oh If karma's really real How am I still here? Just seems so unfair
                I could be wrong though If there's a point to being good Then where's my reward? The good die young and poor I gave it all I could
                Stuck in this terradome All I see is terrible Making us hysterical There's got to be more, got to be more Sick of this head of mine
